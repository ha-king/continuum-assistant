### Testing
```bash
# Test Coinbase integration
cd docker_app
python test_coinbase_simple.py
```

## üìù Development Workflow

2. Make changes and test locally
3. Push to feature branch
4. Create PR to `dev` branch
5. Merge triggers automatic dev deployment
6. Test in dev environment
7. Create PR from `dev` to `main`
8. Merge triggers automatic prod deployment

## üõ†Ô∏è Local Development
