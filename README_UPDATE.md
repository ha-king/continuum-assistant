# Router Fix Update

A critical fix has been implemented to address an issue where all end-user queries were being incorrectly routed to the aviation assistant. This issue has been resolved by improving the keyword matching logic to check for whole words rather than substrings.

## Changes Made
- Fixed keyword matching to use regex for exact word matching
- Improved N-number detection for aviation queries
- Enhanced error handling and logging in the router
- Added a verification script to ensure the fix works correctly

## Testing
The fix has been thoroughly tested with a variety of queries to ensure:
- Non-aviation queries are not routed to the aviation assistant
- Aviation queries are correctly routed to the aviation assistant
