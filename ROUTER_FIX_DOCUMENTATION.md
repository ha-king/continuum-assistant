# Router Fix Documentation

## Issue
The Streamlit app in the continuum-assistant project was incorrectly routing all end-user queries to the aviation assistant. This happened because the keyword matching logic in the router was checking for substrings rather than whole words, causing many false positives.

For example:
- Words like "workflow" would match because it contains "flow" which is part of "flight" in the aviation keywords
- Words like "planet" would match because it contains "plane" which is an aviation keyword

## Fix
We implemented the following changes to fix the routing issue:

1. **Improved the `contains_keywords` function** to check for whole words using regex pattern matching instead of simple substring matching.

2. **Enhanced the `is_n_number` function** to better detect aircraft registration numbers with proper validation.

3. **Rewrote the `has_n_number` function** to consider aviation context and exclude non-aviation contexts like phone numbers or highway designations.

4. **Updated the aviation rule in `ROUTING_RULES`** to be more specific and accurate, using regex for exact word matching.

5. **Enhanced the `smart_route` function** with better error handling and logging of all matching rules.

6. **Created a verification script** to ensure the fix works correctly.

## Testing
The verification script (`verify_router_fix.py`) confirms:
- Non-aviation queries are not routed to the aviation assistant
- Aviation queries are correctly routed to the aviation assistant
- N-number detection works correctly in aviation contexts
- Keyword matching is accurate for all domains

## Results
After implementing these fixes:
- Non-aviation queries are now correctly routed to their appropriate assistants or the default teacher agent
- Aviation queries are still correctly routed to the aviation assistant
- The router is now more robust and accurate in its domain detection
- Detailed logging helps identify which rules matched and why

## Future Improvements
- Consider implementing machine learning-based classification for more accurate domain detection
- Add user feedback mechanism to improve routing over time
