# Streamlit Assistant App - Simplified Architecture

## Core Components

### Unified Assistants
The application now uses a consolidated assistant architecture with 5 core domains:

1. **Business & Finance Assistant**
   - Handles finance, crypto, economics, business development, entrepreneurship
   - Consolidates: financial_assistant, business_assistant, economics_assistant, cryptocurrency_assistant, etc.

2. **Technology & Security Assistant**
   - Handles programming, AI, blockchain, web3, cybersecurity, AWS
   - Consolidates: tech_assistant, security_assistant, computer_science_assistant, aws_assistant, etc.

3. **Research & Knowledge Assistant**
   - Handles research, data analysis, web browsing, math, English, general knowledge
   - Consolidates: research_assistant, web_browser_assistant, data_analysis_assistant, math_assistant, etc.

4. **Specialized Industries Assistant**
   - Handles aviation, Formula 1, sports, legal, automotive industries
   - Consolidates: aviation_assistant, formula1_assistant, sports_assistant, louisiana_legal_assistant, etc.

5. **Universal Assistant**
   - Handles predictions, forecasting, and general queries across all domains
   - Consolidates: universal_assistant, general_assistant, no_expertise

### Unified Router
The routing logic has been simplified into a single file (`unified_router.py`) that:

- Uses domain detection to route queries to the appropriate core assistant
- Maintains specialized routing for high-priority domains (aviation, Formula 1)
- Provides backward compatibility with legacy assistants
- Integrates with telemetry for tracking routing decisions

## Architecture Benefits

- **Reduced Complexity**: Consolidated 15+ individual assistants into 5 core domains
- **Simplified Routing**: Single routing file instead of complex multi-file logic
- **Improved Maintainability**: Easier to update and extend functionality
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy assistants still available for specific use cases
- **Optimized Performance**: Reduced overhead from multiple assistant initializations

## Usage

The application automatically routes user queries to the most appropriate assistant based on the query content. Advanced configuration is still available for users who want fine-grained control over which assistants are used.

## Legacy Support

Legacy assistants are still available and can be enabled in Advanced Configuration mode for backward compatibility.
