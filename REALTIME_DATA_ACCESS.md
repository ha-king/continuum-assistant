## Technical Architecture

### Query Enhancement Flow
1. **Query Reception** → Assistant receives user query
2. **Real-time Enhancement** → `enhance_query_with_realtime()` adds current context
3. **Data Source Selection** → Intelligent selection of relevant data sources
4. **Live Data Retrieval** → Real-time data fetching from multiple APIs
5. **Context Integration** → Seamless integration of live data with query
6. **Enhanced Response** → Assistant provides current, accurate information

### Data Source Integration
```python
# Automatic real-time enhancement for all assistants
enhanced_query = enhance_query_with_realtime(query, assistant_type)

# Includes:
# - Current date/time context
# - Relevant live data (crypto, F1, web, news)
# - Domain-specific real-time information
# - Error handling and fallbacks
```

### Error Handling & Reliability
- **Graceful degradation** when APIs are unavailable
- **Multiple data source fallbacks** for redundancy
- **Timeout protection** to prevent hanging requests
- **Cached responses** for improved performance

## Benefits

### For Users
- **Always current information** across all assistants
- **Real-time market data** for financial queries
- **Live sports and F1 updates** with current context
- **Current web and company intelligence**
- **Up-to-date technical guidance** and best practices

### For Developers
- **Centralized data access** reduces code duplication
- **Consistent real-time capabilities** across all assistants
- **Easy maintenance** and updates through single module
- **Scalable architecture** for adding new data sources

## Data Sources & APIs

### Currently Integrated
- **CoinGecko API** - Cryptocurrency market data
